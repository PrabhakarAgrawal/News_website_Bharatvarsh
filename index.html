            Dinesh Karthik’s last-over heroics set up a competitive total after Kohli flatters to deceive, but it was the fall of Conway that triggered Chennai’s downfall in the chase.For a while, it seemed no one was going to stay with Dinesh Karthik and allow him to do his thing but luckily, for Royal Challengers Bangalore, he got strike for a full over in the 20th. And he made it count. Dwaine Pretorius wasn’t too far from the blockhole but Karthik retreated so far back into the crease, with his back leg adjacent to the off-stump, that he somehow managed to swing two stunning sixes over the legside to loot 16 valuable runs in the over..It was the difference between a good total on a pitch that helped turn and where the ball held up a touch, and a below-par one. In this season, Karthik has time and again shown that he doesn’t just slog, but picks his shots and the bowlers to go after. Here he had no choice but to go after the ball in the last over, but even then, it wasn’t mindless slogging. He made his moves in the crease, targeted his areas, and was successful in dragging RCB to a competitive total.

            Madrid trailed 1-0 on the night and 5-3 on aggregate heading into the 90th minute after Riyad Mahrez's 73rd-minute goal looked set to send City to their second successive Champions League final. But, as dramatic comebacks against Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea have already shown in this season's competition, Madrid are never to be counted out.And they saved their most incredible feat for this night. After coming off the bench, Rodrygo scored in the 90th and 91st minutes to level the aggregate score and send the Bernabeu crowd into bedlam and the semifinal to extra time. With City shaken, Benzema then won and scored a penalty in the first five minutes of extra time to give Madrid a lead they would not relinquish.As they seek a record-extending 14th European Cup, Madrid will now take on six-time winners Liverpool in the final at the Stade de France later this month. No one will be writing them off."Incredible," Madrid's Casemiro told Movistar Plus afterward. "There's no better feeling, no way to explain this, how difficult it was to get here. The best is yet to come, the most important [thing] is yet to come, but we have to enjoy the moment. ... We're in the final, but the most difficult is yet to come.

            Social media giant Twitter jolted the social-media world last week by agreeing to sell itself to entrepreneur and self-described “free-speech absolutist” Elon Musk for $44 billion. The Tesla chief executive has indicated a desire to loosen the site’s content moderation policies, which some see as unduly targeting conservatives, and unlock value that the company’s current leadership can’t. The Opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal look at how the deal came about, why it matters, and how it might change the way we communicate online.I was out for a walk last Thursday when Elon Musk tweeted a political cartoon that I created in August 2021. It received hundreds of thousands of retweets and more than 1.5 million likes. The stick figure in the middle depicts me, a center-left liberal in 2008, and how the ground had shifted under my feet by 2012 and 2021.My, what a progressive panic Elon Musk’s $44 billion purchase of Twitter has inspired. MSNBC host Ari Melber warns that Mr. Musk could hack the political debate by having the website “secretly ban one party’s candidate” or “turn down the reach of their stuff, and turn up the reach of something else, and the rest of us might not even find out about it until after the election.”

            The inaugural of “The Commission for Dialogue” with the United Kingdom on the Falkland Islands has run into rough weather as members of the commission from the BJP declined to attend the event after the party expressed uneasiness over the launch just two days after hosting U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Launching the Commission here on Sunday, Foreign Minister of Argentina Santiago Cafiero acknowledged India’s traditional support for resolving the “territorial dispute” and said, “Argentina and India share same anti–colonial heritage and values”.Mr. Cafiero declared launch of the Commission in the presence of a large number of envoys based here. However, former Union Minister and BJP leader Suresh Prabhu, who was scheduled to appear at the event, stayed away. “I am currently travelling to the United States to visit several universities and speaking there. I am not thus obviously part of this event as reported,” he said in a social media message in response to The Hindu’s story of Sunday.BJP spokeperson Shazia Ilmi, whose name appeared in the list of members of the Commission, made a brief appearance before the launch of the formal segment but did not stay for the actual launch of the Commission.

      <h3 class="artitl">VR with muscle-stimulating tech that can force you to move your head </h3>

       

      <div class="container">
          <p>
            Applying muscle-stimulating electrodes to carefully selected points on the necks of volunteers can force the wearer to look up or down, or side to side  which could be useful for steering attention in a 3D virtual reality training or gaming environment, but potentially in augmented reality applications in the real world, too. Currently, the only systems capable of steering the head are the robotic exoskeletons used by medics for neck rehabilitation

            
              <span class="read-more-text">
                It might sound like taking a sinister level of control of somebody’s body, but the underlying idea, says Yudai Tanaka at the University of Chicago, is to create a way of steering a user’s attention to something they really need to see.

      <h3 class="artitl">Why Brittney Griner Could Be the Last American Basketball Star in Russia</h3>

      <div class="container">
          <p>
            Mike Cound had decided on a figure — a reasonable salary request, he said — for a client who wanted to play for UMMC Yekaterinburg, a professional women’s basketball team in Russia. As an experienced sports agent, that was what he was supposed to do.

            
              <span class="read-more-text">
                But when he doubled the request on a whim, the team accepted without hesitation. And when another client injured her knee and could not play, the team paid her anyway. For yet another client, UMMC Yekaterinburg offered more than triple the amount she could make in the W.N.B.A. in the United States — if she would agree to play only in Russia.
            
            None of that was normal. But UMMC Yekaterinburg was not like any other team.
            
            “There’s nothing like it in sports,” Cound said. “The Yankees, maybe, in the old days with George Steinbrenner, when they would pay four times as much as somebody else.”
            
            That type of spending and largess, fed by the Russian oligarchs who own teams for pride and political reasons, has drawn many W.N.B.A. players over the years to a country they barely know, thousands of miles from home, for a financial bounty generally unavailable in the United States.
